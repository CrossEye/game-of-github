## How to use

### As a bookmarklet

You can drag the Game of GitHub bookmarklet from
[https://glebbahmutov.com/game-of-github/](https://glebbahmutov.com/game-of-github/)

Manually you can create bookmarklet from
[index.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bahmutov/game-of-github/master/index.min.js) - do not forget to prepend code with `javascript:` when
saving the bookmarklet.

### Copy / paste

- Copy contents of [index.js](index.js)
- Open DevTools while on `https://github.com/username`
- Paste contents into the DevTools console

It should start the "Game of GitHub" ðŸ˜Ž

**Hint** [https://github.com/lholznagel](https://github.com/lholznagel) has
the [most awesome one](https://youtu.be/52-BfHPTtnE)! Much better than my
little [oscillators](https://youtu.be/gowPfBWkBKc).

### As a code snippet

- Open DevTools / Sources tab
- Open "Snippets" left tab
- Right click and create new snippet
- Paste the [index.js](index.js) and Save (Right click and select "Save")

Now you can run this snippet over and over.
